Formal proofs using SMT2 solvers (Yices, Z3, CVC4, MathSAT, etc.)


chip
----

Post-synthesis proofs from lattice ice40 bitstream files. Make changes as
neccessary to perform a proof. (Used only for hardcore debugging sessions.)


slave_send_length
-----------------

Proves that when the slave is sending, it will ultimately stop sending after at
least 800 cycles (for the most simple [1 2 3 4 5] send timings).
